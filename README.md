# RESPECT V INFO Service (Public)
https://djmax.slime.kr

Ladder match information service for DJMAX RESPECT V.

**This repository contains service code excluding core modules.**

## Where have you been?
after the v145 patch, the ladder information could not be obtained in the conventional way, so i ended the service.

source code has not been refactored, so it can be difficult to read :(

Thank you to all users who have used the service in the meantime.

## Requirements
```
python3.8+
django3+
elasticsearch
